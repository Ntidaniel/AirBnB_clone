# AirBnB Clone  Project - The Cnsole

## Description
This project is a clone of the AirBnB website, implemented as a command-line interface (CLI) application. It allows users to manage AirBnB objects such as users, listings, bookings, and reviews.

## Command Interpreter
The command interpreter is a Python script (`console.py`) that provides an interactive interface for managing AirBnB objects. It supports various commands for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting objects.

## How to Start
To start the command interpreter, simply run the `console.py` script using Python 3:


## How to Use
Once the command interpreter is running, you can enter commands to manage AirBnB objects. Here are some example commands:

- `create User`: Create a new user.
- `show Listing 123`: Show details of listing with ID 123.
- `update Booking 456 start_date "2024-03-15"`: Update the start date of booking 456.

## Examples
Here are some examples of using the command interpreter:

(hbnb) create User
User created with ID: 1
(hbnb) show User 1
Details of User with ID 1:

Name: John Doe
Email: john@example.com
(hbnb) quit
